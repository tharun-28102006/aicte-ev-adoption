# ðŸš— EV Adoption Analysis - AICTE Internship (Week 1)

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
As electric vehicle (EV) adoption surges, urban planners need to anticipate infrastructure needsâ€”especially charging stations. Inadequate planning can lead to bottlenecks, impacting user satisfaction and hindering sustainability goals.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Analyze historical EV adoption data to understand:
- Overall EV growth trend over time
- Distribution of EV adoption across counties
- Comparison between BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) and PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles)

This forms the foundation for **Week 2 forecasting models**.
