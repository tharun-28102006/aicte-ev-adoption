# âš¡ Electric Vehicle (EV) Demand Forecasting using Machine Learning

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning-based forecasting system to predict the **state-wise monthly electric vehicle (EV) demand in India**. With the increasing importance of sustainable transportation, predicting future EV demand can help policymakers, manufacturers, and infrastructure developers make data-driven decisions.

The project uses **regression-based machine learning models** trained on real-world features like fuel prices, government EV policies, number of charging stations, per capita income, population, and estimated energy demand.

## ðŸ”Ž Problem Statement

As electric vehicles gain traction in India, **predicting their adoption rate** becomes crucial for urban planning, infrastructure development, and energy management. However, forecasting EV demand is challenging due to the involvement of multiple dynamic factors like fuel prices, government policies, and income levels.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution

The project proposes a **regression-based predictive model** trained on historical EV registration data enriched with external features. The key steps include:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Feature selection based on correlation with target.
- Model training using different regression algorithms.
- Performance evaluation using RMSE, RÂ² score.
- Future EV demand forecasting (2025â€“2027).
- Simple interactive frontend using Streamlit for real-time predictions.

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Historical EV registration data (state/county-wise)
   - External features: Fuel Price, Policy Strength, Charging Stations, Income, Population, Energy Demand

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Date conversion and time-based grouping  
   - Outlier removal and normalization  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Feature importance (Random Forest)  
   - Selection of most influential features  

4. **Model Building**  
   - Tried models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost  
   - Chosen model: **XGBoost** (best performance in accuracy and generalization)  

5. **Forecasting Future Demand**  
   - Used trained model to predict demand for next 3 years (2025â€“2027)  
   - Scenario-based predictions (e.g., increasing fuel price, better policies)

6. **Web App Interface**  
   - Built with Streamlit  
   - Allows manual input of feature values and gives real-time EV demand predictions
